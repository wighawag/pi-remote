Fix duplicate parallel sessions when switching between the CLI and the web frontend.

Root cause was a pi SDK version skew: the standalone server and the CLI-bridge extension were pinned to `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent@^0.75.3`, while the user's `pi` binary had moved to 0.80.x. pi >=0.80 canonicalizes the cwd (resolving trailing slashes and `.`/`..` segments) before encoding the session directory name, whereas <0.80 encoded the raw cwd. Because the server keys its in-memory session map by the session file path, the 0.75-built server and the 0.80 CLI produced two different path strings for the same logical session, so the browser and the terminal ended up attached to two separate tracked sessions.

Changes:

- Bump the server and extension to `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent@^0.80.3` (and pin `@earendil-works/pi-ai` to `^0.80.3`) so both sides use the same session-directory encoding as a modern pi CLI.
- Harden the pool against any future version skew: a new `normalizeSessionFile()` canonicalizes the session file path at every map-key boundary (`registerCliSession`, `unregisterCliSession`, `handleCliEvent`, `getSession`, `loadSession`, `createNewSession`, and the active-session lookup in the session listing), so a CLI-reported path and a server-computed path converge on one key regardless of trailing slashes, `.`/`..` segments, or an SDK mismatch.
