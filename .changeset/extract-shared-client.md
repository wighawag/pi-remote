Extract core client WebSocket and state management logic into a dedicated, framework-agnostic `@wherever-dev/client` monorepo package. Update both the web dashboard (`@wherever-dev/web`) and the CLI extension (`@wherever-dev/pi`) to use the new shared client, reducing duplicate code and establishing a modular architecture for future integrations.
