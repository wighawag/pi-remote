# pi-remote

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 2b2a81e: Add the ability to send images and documents by uploading them to a configurable server-side folder and appending their absolute paths to the user's message so the agent can read and process them.
- dda50b5: Add hint on the main screen stating that the sidebar can be used to open existing/running sessions.
  - format files

- 696abee: auto-completion path
- e890743: Add support for executing bash commands directly from the Svelte web frontend using the `!` prefix (e.g., `!ls`, `!!git status`), matching the pi CLI's interactive behavior.
  - Intercepts prompts starting with `!` or `!!` on the server and runs them through the active AgentSession's executeBash or forwards them as `cli_bash` messages to the CLI bridge client.
  - Streams tool execution chunk updates back to the Svelte client in real-time.
  - Captures output and exit status and persists them to the session log as a `bashExecution` history message.
  - Supports raw output streaming of direct shell command executions.

- ce9aff8: Document all advanced features in the main README and enrich the USAEG guide with HTTP endpoints and WebSocket events.
- bf81616: git remote repo creation
