// promise whose resolver had just been pushed onto resolveQueue, but the
// running pass had already CLAIMED that queue and nothing scheduled a further
// pass -- so `await fetchSessions()` during an in-flight fetch could hang
// forever. Every returned promise must settle, and mid-flight requests must
// collapse into exactly one trailing re-fetch.
