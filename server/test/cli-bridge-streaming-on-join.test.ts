// Bug: joining an existing session that a pi CLI is CURRENTLY running a long
// tool call on shows Abort disabled + an enabled composer, while the CLI is
// still waiting for the tool. Root cause: registerCliSession hardcodes
// isStreaming=false, and the CLI only forwards agent_start/agent_end as they
// happen. If the turn was already in progress when the bridge registered (server
// restart, bridge reconnect mid-turn), the server never learns it is streaming,
// so a viewer that joins sees isStreaming=false.
//
// The fix: the CLI reports its CURRENT streaming state at register time
// (cli_register carries isStreaming), and the server honors it. This test drives
// the register handshake directly (no real pi CLI needed) by sending a
// cli_register frame with isStreaming: true, then joins as a viewer and asserts
// the viewer sees the session as streaming (Abort enabled).
