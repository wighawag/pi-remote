# wherever-dev

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 76522ac: Add standalone marketing/info website for GitHub Pages deployment. The new `site/` folder contains a SvelteKit + TailwindCSS static site with a landing page featuring hero section, features grid, architecture diagram, install guide, and footer. Includes a custom SVG logo with a pi symbol made of tetris-like blocks and signal waves. Deployed automatically via GitHub Actions workflow on push to main.

### Patch Changes

- bb36b59: Automatically expand shell/bash command tool calls in the remote web dashboard when the user executes a prompt starting with "!" or "!!".
- 8626cd3: Automatically update the session browser list in the sidebar in real time whenever a session is created, loaded, left, when client connections open or close, and when messages or agent cycles end.
- 26cba7b: Add toggles for hiding tool calls and thinking messages in the chat UI.
- e5fae9d: Maximize available horizontal space in the header for the workspace folder path by displaying the agent status (Ready vs. Agent working) directly on the robot model selector icon, removing the redundant text status indicators.
- e87ab30: Add "Hide thinking steps" and "Hide tool calls" options in the config UI to clean up the chat log. "Hide tool calls" keeps tool execution blocks visible if they are associated with explicit user terminal commands starting with `!` or `!!`.
- bb0bc3d: Normalize `cwd` paths in the server's session pool before creating, loading, or registering sessions. This resolves duplicate session folders when a workspace is accessed with vs. without a trailing slash (e.g. `--home-wighawag...--` vs `--home-wighawag...---`), fragments conversation history, and handles relative segments and double slashes.
- 01e6641: Fix the `/new` / `session_new` command on the server so that it successfully creates a brand new, clean session instead of returning the existing active session when the requesting client is already connected to it.
- 0630cff: Add a full-screen loading overlay on the main screen during session creation. This prevents users from initiating multiple simultaneous session creations and provides visual feedback during the creation delay.
- afe5ebc: Change sessions in the sidebar session browser to standard anchor links, allowing users to middle-click, command-click, or right-click to open sessions in new tabs.
- 70a974a: Configure both `web` and `site` packages for static site pre-rendering by setting `prerender = true` (in page/layout routing) and removing `fallback: 'index.html'` from the svelte static adapter configs. This enables SvelteKit to generate correct, portable relative-path references in the built HTML files, allowing the dashboard and marketing website to load perfectly under subpaths or IPFS gateways.
- ae04a3c: Redesign the remote web dashboard to match the brand design system and colors of the marketing website, introducing brand-dark, brand-surface, brand-border, emerald, and rose theme tokens across all UI components, dialogs, inputs, and layout blocks.

## 0.0.4

### Patch Changes

- 393e8aa: update to port 31415

## 0.0.3

### Patch Changes

- e54e697: Allow users to collapse folders in the session browser even when a filter query is active, with automatic reset of search-specific folder expansions when clearing the search query.
- 948ad33: fix: show full folder path under folder name in session sidebar

  When multiple directories share the same basename (e.g. `/home/user/wighawag`
  and `/home/user/projects/wighawag`), they appeared as separate groups with the
  same visible name, making them indistinguishable. Now the full resolved path is
  shown in smaller gray text beneath the folder name for easy differentiation.

- 14f1269: Show queued message text in input box as greyed-out italic text when agent is streaming

  When a message is queued (sent while agent is working), the text is now visible in the disabled textarea in a grey italic style instead of being hidden. Unqueueing clears the text and re-enables editing. Also added a refresh button (↻) next to the session filter in the sidebar to manually refresh the session list, with a spinning animation while loading.

- d319cfd: Fixed session list issues in the sidebar:
  - Fixed duplicate folder entries by properly resolving path representations (like expanding ~ and relative paths) consistently on the server.
  - Added keyed loops in Svelte `#each` blocks to make session list rendering reactive and prevent unnecessary DOM rebuilds.
  - Debounced `fetchSessions()` calls to coalesce rapid concurrent requests during bulk operations.
  - Added a "Delete All" button inside each folder's expanded session list to delete all sessions of that folder at once.
  - Prevented visual reloading/layout-flashing by keeping the existing list visible during background refreshes, only displaying the loading spinner on initial load when the folder list is empty.

- a697a2d: Ensure model choices are preserved across page reloads, server restarts, and synchronized dynamically between web and CLI.

  Specifically:
  - Fixed an issue where the model resolved to the first (oldest) model_change entry on session reload/restart instead of the most recent one.
  - Added model_select event propagation so that changing the model in a CLI session dynamically updates any connected web client.
  - Added support in the CLI bridge extension to receive and apply model changes initiated from the remote web dashboard.

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 2b2a81e: Add the ability to send images and documents by uploading them to a configurable server-side folder and appending their absolute paths to the user's message so the agent can read and process them.
- dda50b5: Add hint on the main screen stating that the sidebar can be used to open existing/running sessions.
  - format files

- 4859ae8: remove empty message from the conversation
- 1ae3216: Compress session list folders by default and support inline session deletion with double-confirmation, syncing state instantly across all clients. Fix mobile browser layout issues on Firefox by locking page overscroll and constraining container layout to visual viewport boundaries.
- 696abee: auto-completion path
- 66f8354: common folder
- e890743: Add support for executing bash commands directly from the Svelte web frontend using the `!` prefix (e.g., `!ls`, `!!git status`), matching the pi CLI's interactive behavior.
  - Intercepts prompts starting with `!` or `!!` on the server and runs them through the active AgentSession's executeBash or forwards them as `cli_bash` messages to the CLI bridge client.
  - Streams tool execution chunk updates back to the Svelte client in real-time.
  - Captures output and exit status and persists them to the session log as a `bashExecution` history message.
  - Supports raw output streaming of direct shell command executions.

- ce9aff8: Document all advanced features in the main README and enrich the USAEG guide with HTTP endpoints and WebSocket events.
- 002e622: fix abort on reload
- 49bc222: better side bar
- bf81616: git remote repo creation
- 2a1466a: speech api
- b8acc26: Improve speech recording feedback and reliability:
  - Transition from `MediaRecorder` to direct `AudioContext` / PCM buffer capture for instant, zero-latency WAV creation.
  - Add an audible synthesizer beep / chime on recording start for clear user feedback.
  - Introduce an explicit `isProcessing` state during local downsampling and cloud transcription to replace the red pulsing mic indicator with an orange processing indicator.
- 0a6f84e: remove empty message from the conversation and fix url hash persistence
- 99c1afa: Remove the clear button from the chat list and add a way to collapse the text input bar for easier reading on mobile. Clicking the collapsed bar expands the input and automatically focuses the textarea.
- ba41c2a: better enter keys for send
- 5ba8fd3: add option to upload via normal post request
