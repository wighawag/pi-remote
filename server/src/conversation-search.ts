/**
 * Conversation search: full-text search over EVERY past session, backed by the
 * memonaut index (`~/.local/share/memonaut/index.db`, an SQLite FTS5 file built
 * from the same `~/.pi/agent/sessions` transcripts wherever lists).
 *
 * Three rules hold this module together; breaking any of them breaks the server.
 *
 * 1. **NEVER build the index on a request path.** memonaut is built on
 *    `node:sqlite`, which is SYNCHRONOUS, and so is its indexer: a full build of
 *    a real corpus is ~40 s of blocked event loop, which would freeze every
 *    WebSocket client (the same failure mode the /sessions cache exists to
 *    avoid, see CONTEXT.md "Session-list cost control"). So `index()` is never
 *    called here, and neither is `syncIfStale()` (it opens the DB READ-WRITE and
 *    can itself trigger a full rebuild). Catch-up is delegated to a CHILD
 *    PROCESS (`maybeSpawnSync`), TTL-gated and never awaited. A missing index is
 *    a well-formed answer telling the user to run `recall index`, NOT an inline
 *    build.
 *    What DOES run in-process is one `search()` call: measured at 14-66 ms on a
 *    real index (open ~0 ms, `indexStats` ~17 ms, ~100-120 ms end to end for the
 *    whole endpoint, on 3,822 files / 464k entries). That is the same order as a
 *    warm /sessions pass and only happens on a debounced human action, so it is
 *    acceptable; anything heavier is not.
 *
 * 2. **Read-only, always.** The index belongs to memonaut. wherever opens it
 *    with `{readOnly: true}` (which also sets `PRAGMA query_only`) and never
 *    writes a byte.
 *
 * 3. **Two privacy axes, composed in ONE place** (`filterThreads` below).
 *    memonaut's `ignore`/`private` govern what is INDEXED and what AGENTS may
 *    read; wherever's `sessions.ignore`/`sessions.readOnly` govern what the
 *    DASHBOARD shows. Search is a dashboard surface, so it must obey the
 *    dashboard's rules on top of memonaut's, or it becomes a way to read back
 *    exactly what the user hid from the dashboard.

 * - wherever `sessions.readOnly`: mirrors /sessions exactly. `view=default`

 *
 * Filtering is per THREAD, not per hit: one entry in shared fork history can be
 * carried by both a visible and a hidden session. `threadTotal` is recomputed
 * from the surviving threads, so a hidden fork does not leak even as a count.
 * A thread whose cwd is unknown is dropped (fail closed).
 *
 * Known limitation: matching is on the RESOLVED path (`path.resolve`, matching
 * `/sessions`), which does not follow symlinks. A cwd reached through a symlink
 * can therefore fail to match a glob written against its real path, exactly as
 * it would in the session list; the two surfaces stay consistent, which is the
 * property that matters here.
