/**
 * Bounded-memory readers for session `.jsonl` transcripts.
 *
 * A pi session file is an append-only JSONL transcript, and on a real machine
 * that corpus is GIGABYTES (measured: 3,831 files / 2.0 GB, single files up to
 * 62 MB). Every reader in this server therefore has ONE hard rule:
 *
 *   **Never materialize a whole transcript.**
 *
 * That rule is not a micro-optimization, it is the difference between a server
 * that idles at tens of MB and one systemd-oomd kills. The two paths that used
 * to break it, and what they cost, are:
 *
 *  - the `/sessions` listing scan, which did `readFile(utf8)` + `split('\n')` +
 *    `JSON.parse` per line into a RETAINED `entries[]` array, per file. One
 *    62 MB transcript becomes a 62 MB string, a ~62 MB array of line strings and
 *    a few hundred MB of parsed objects, all live at once. Startup (which warms
 *    the listing cache) peaked at ~1.0 GB RSS and settled at ~460 MB.
 *  - every history read (`session_load`, `history_page`, `cli_register`), which
 *    went through pi's `SessionManager.open()` (which loads and parses the WHOLE
 *    file TWICE) and then mapped EVERY entry into a `HistoryMessage[]`
 *    (including base64 tool images) only to slice the last 60. Repeated for the
 *    life of the process, so RSS ratchets up and never comes back down.
 *
 * Both are replaced by streaming passes here, in three layers:
 *
 *  1. newlines are found in the BYTES of a pooled 64 KB chunk, so nothing is
 *     decoded just to be looked at;
 *  2. each line is classified from a bounded 512-byte HEAD, and a line the
 *     caller does not want is DISCARDED without ever becoming a string;
 *  3. only the wanted lines are decoded and parsed, and the parse result is
 *     dropped unless it belongs in the answer.
 *
 * So peak memory is bounded by the largest line we actually WANT (tool results,
 * which are most of a transcript's bytes, are never assembled), and the retained
 * result is bounded by what the caller asked for: one small listing record, or
 * one window of history.
 *
 * The readers are async and yield between chunks so a multi-MB transcript can
 * never pin the event loop (which is what made "Loading session..." hang before
 * the listing scan was made async).
 *
 * Measured on that 2.0 GB corpus (built server, same method on both sides):
 * startup peak RSS 990 MB -> 208 MB; opening the largest session (59 MB) 401 ms
 * of blocked loop and ~130 MB per open -> 71 ms non-blocking, plateauing at
 * ~340 MB over 150 consecutive opens with live heap flat at 39 MB.
 * `server/test/bench/` holds the harnesses; re-measure there before trusting a
 * change to this file.

 *  - with `beforeOffset`: the `limit` messages ending just before it, clamped to
 *    the real total.
 *
 * Done as TWO bounded passes rather than one. Pass 1 reads the WHOLE file and
 * materializes nothing (every tool result is behind the window by construction),
 * which is what makes `header`, `model` -- the LAST `model_change`, so only a
 * full pass can know it -- and `totalCount` authoritative. Pass 2 then reads only
 * as far as the window and materializes only the window itself. Both read from
 * the page cache and neither ever holds more than the window, which is what a
 * "give me 60 messages" request is allowed to cost on a 60 MB transcript. The
 * old path built a `HistoryMessage` for EVERY entry -- base64 tool images
 * included -- and threw all but 60 away, three whole-file loads deep (two of
 * them inside `SessionManager.open`).
 *
 * Everything except `messages` therefore comes from pass 1, deliberately: pass 2
 * stops early, so its own header/model/total would be partial. An append landing
 * between the passes cannot corrupt the answer either -- entries before the
 * append keep their indices, so the window pass 2 reads is exactly the window
 * pass 1 measured, and the reported total/offset describe that same snapshot.
