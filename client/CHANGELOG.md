# @wherever-dev/client

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 37de34b: Extract core client WebSocket and state management logic into a dedicated, framework-agnostic `@wherever-dev/client` monorepo package. Update both the web dashboard (`@wherever-dev/web`) and the CLI extension (`@wherever-dev/pi`) to use the new shared client, reducing duplicate code and establishing a modular architecture for future integrations.
- ffd28c7: Speed up loading of long sessions with tail-first history windowing. On load/join, the server now sends only the most recent messages (with a total count and offset) instead of the entire history in one payload, and the web dashboard shows a "Load older messages" button that lazily fetches earlier windows (with scroll-position anchoring). This adds `history_load_more` / `message_history_prepend` to the protocol and a `loadMoreHistory()` method plus history pagination state to `@wherever-dev/client`.
